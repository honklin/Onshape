# Onshape Certification

### Description
We did several practice assignments to practice for the Onshape Certification test using single part, multipart, and assembly assignments. The Onshape Certification exam tests our knowledge of Onshape through general knowledge, single part, multipart, and assembly portions and certifies that anyone who passes is proficient at modeling in Onshape.

Results from my Onshape Certification Exam

### Reflection
I passed the Onshape Certification Exam with an 83%. I found the exam to be pretty challenging, but I was able to pass by doing several practice assignments with time limits. 

Single Part Section:
I knew the single part section would be the simplest of the three parts so I had to spend as little time on this part as I could. Based on the practice assignments like the Swing Arm or the first single part assignment, I knew that the part I would have to design would be relatively simple, but with one or two more complicated parts that was probably built around one sketch. I learned from doing the practice assignments that you had to look out for small details in the reference images that would show some feature that would drastically mess up my answers if I overlooked it, like the almost invisible ledge on the Swing Arm. I knew that I had to get the first design question right, otherwise when I tried to answer the others with  varying edits to the features, I would get the wrong answer to all of them, so I double checked my work before going on to question 2. By doing the practice assignments with the time limit, I found that the only way I would finish on time was if I got the design right the first time and didn't have to go back and find the small error I had made. I found this section exam on the pretty easy and managed to get all the questions right while also finishing with some time left over.

Multipart Section:
I knew that the multipart section would be one of the hardest sections because if I made a mistake, even a small one, it would be extremely hard to fix it in time. One of the challenges I had found from doing the multipart practice assignments was that if I made a small mistake in one of the parts, the entire model could be messed up because the parts all rely on each other for dimensions. On the practice multiparts, if I fixed a mistake, it would cause errors in every part added after that so I found that I had to work very carefully and that I could under no circumstances delete a sketched part and replace it with a new one. I had to use the time I had made up in the single part section to finish my model because as I had predicted, I had made a small mistake that took me a very long time to correct. I knew that I had to get the first question right if I wanted to get any of the others right based on what I found on the practice assignments, but on the test, I actually got the first question wrong either because I had made a small mistake or just put in the wrong answer. However, I still managed to get the next two questions right, even though I had started with an incorrect model. I found this to be the most challenging part of the exam and I spent too much time on this secion trying to fix my model, but I only got two questions wrong on this section.

Assembly Section:
I knew that the assembly would probably be the most challenging for me because I didn't understand limits as well as I would have liked and I wasn't able to finish the part within the time frame on the plier practice assignment. I had spent too much time on the multipart so I was crunched for time and after looking through the part I had to design, I knew that I wouldn't be able to finish this on time so I decided to eyeball the mates and limits. I only did two or three mates and had no limits in my entire design, but I moved the pieces to where it looked like they were supposed to line up and adjusted the position and rotations until the measurement tool showed that the pieces were the correct distance and angle from each other. Surprisingly, the values that I found were available in the answer choices, even though this was definitely not the method that would have been recommended for this section. In this section, I somehow managed to get five out of the six questions correct, and without those questions I wouldn't have been able to pass the exam.

General Knowledge Section:
The general knowledge portion was the easiest of the sections because I could use the internet and my own experiences to answer the questions. When taking practice tests, I had found that if I needed to look up an answer I had to search it very fast and not spend minutes looking for it, otherwise I would waste a lot of time in this section that I needed on the modeling sections. I found most of the questions to be very similar to how I use Onshape so I could use my prior knowledge on most of the questions. On this section of the exam, I got 25 out of the 30 questions correct.
